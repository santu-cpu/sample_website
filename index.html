  <h1>Learn HTML</h1>
  <p>
    There are so many things <em><strong>to learn</strong></em>. How many and how soon can one do that? But still one must <strong><em>keep learning</em></strong> without getting bogged down by them.
    <a href="http://learnenough.com">This is a good website</a> to learn html.
  </p>
  <h2>The basics</h2>
  <p>
    Also <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> is a good source for this.HTML was created by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners Lee</a> and it's not true that he invented it to share pictures of his cat.

  <h3>Quotations</h3>

  <p>
    In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the Web is also full of inspiring quotes,perhaps none more so than this one:
  </p>
  <p>
    <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px;background: #00acde">
      <p>
        <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
        <br>
        -Abraham Lincoln
      </p>
    </blockquote>
